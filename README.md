# Bee-Solver
Small script to spit out answers for the NY Times' Spelling Bee Game.  
Figured I could make a little something to find some of the more esoteric words for the game when I got stuck.  
Currently using a scrabble dictionary because I can't find a list that the times uses for its words.  
The scrabble dic seems to be a super set of the times word list, but with somewhere between 25 - 50% more words. Meaning you'll enter in plenty of unaccepted answers, but, as of 4/20(nice)/2022, it hasn't missed a word since the scrabble dic has been used, starting in March.  
    
Next steps:
- GUI
- Incorporating the hints to filter results
- Option to pull from the web instead of manual entry
